Aggregate data types,,,,,
Unpacked structures,"represents a collection of data types that can be referenced as a whole,can contain any data type.By default, structures are unpacked.Dynamic types and chandle types can only be used in tagged union",7.2 Structures,T.B.D,T.B.D,T.B.D
Packed structures,"packed structure consists of bit fields, which are packed together in
memory without gaps.it is a mechanism for subdividing a vector into subfields, which can be conveniently
accessed as members",7.2 Structures,T.B.D,T.B.D,T.B.D
Unpacked union," ""it is a data type that represents a single piece of storage that can be accessed using one of the named member data types. Only one of the data types in the union can be used at a time. By default  a union is packed""",7.3 Unions,T.B.D,T.B.D,T.B.D
Packet  union,"The members of a packed,untagged union shall all be the same size (in contrast to an unpacked union or a packed, tagged union, where the members can be different sizes). Thus, a union member that was written as another member can be readback.",7.3.1 Packed unions,T.B.D,T.B.D,T.B.D
Tagged unions,"A tagged union stores both the member value and a tag, i.e.,additional bits representing the current member name.The member value can only be read with a type that is consistent with the current tag value (i.e., member name).A packed array is guaranteed to be represented as a contiguous set of bits.",7.3.2 Tagged unions,T.B.D,T.B.D,T.B.D
Arrays,,,,,
Unpacked arrays,array is used to refer to the dimensions declared after the data identifier name.Elements of net arrays can be used in the same fashion as a scalar or vector net,7.4.2 Unpacked arrays,T.B.D,T.B.D,T.B.D
Packed arrays,"packed array is used to refer to the dimensions declared before the data identifier name dynamic arrays,associative arrays",7.4.1 Packed arrays,T.B.D,T.B.D,T.B.D
fixed-size arrays,array is a container object that holds a fixed number of values of a single type.,7.4.2 Unpacked arrays,T.B.D,T.B.D,T.B.D
