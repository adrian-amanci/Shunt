Packed structures,N/A/,"packed structure consists of bit fields, which are packed together in
memory without gaps.it is a mechanism for subdividing a vector into subfields, which can be conveniently
accessed as members",T.B.D,,

Unpacked union,N/A," ""it is a data type that represents a single piece of storage that can be accessed using one of the named member data types. Only one of the data types in the union can be used at a time. By default  a union is packed""",T.B.D,,
Packed  union,N/A,"A tagged union stores both the member value and a tag, i.e.,additional bits representing the current member name.The member value can only be read with a type that is consistent with the current tag value (i.e., member name).A packed array is guaranteed to be represented as a contiguous set of bits.",T.B.D,,
